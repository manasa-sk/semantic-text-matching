What agencies we can hire a car and a driver I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver have heard some agencies here in DOha do it any tips Many thanks 	My experience with Eurodollar I asked them about what happens if there is a minor scratch They say that there are sometimes charges of 20 30 QR A few weeks later the car needed to come into service The car had small scratch on front bumper They make a big deal of it even though I am pretty sure it was there before I hired it After service they did not mention it and I took it out for another month Next day they phoned me saying it would need to be charged at 450 QR I tell them that they are taking the piss and ask to speak to the manager A man phones later and insists I pay it claiming I need things like police reports etc when I refuse he tells me to return the car I say no problem if you give me back my money for the month I have hired the car I suggest he comes into work and picks up the car He does not come in and does not phone again Next day car has a problem and won t start it has lots of little problems due to poor servicing They come out with new key but take much longer than they said they would The same guy finally turns up with another who looks threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch I tell them my feelings that it is minor but he makes a big deal about needing to get the whole bumper re sprayed and that anybody doing the job for 100 QR as I thought reasonable would not do a good job He says that as I am such a pal he will reduce it to 350 QR and that he will pay the remaining 100 QR Basically I have to agree to pay or there will be no new key I take the car to the main dealers and they quote 100 QR I believe that it is not likely that the main dealers for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it comes to spraying I suggest you avoid Eurodollar as they are trying to squeeze money out of any opportunity Even worse than the other car hire places I have tried 	1

halal frozen beef meat how many of you buy or eat halal frozen beef meat which is imported from other countries 	This is one good article i found on net Is Halal meat Halal The title of this article is a bit misleading I do eat halal meat but only that which I have either slaughtered myself or from someone I know trust and am confident can slaughter an animal properly This may come across as a rather elitist viewpoint but it is only that my viewpoint which I admit is more personal that strictly religious In my early years of Islam meat was just that meat I like everyone else simply looked for the halal logo on a packet of meat the shop window or restaurant I consumed a reasonable amount of meat per week However things started to change On one hand I started to realise that the phrase you are what you eat is literally true I noticed a huge difference in my health outlook and religious state after periods of being vegetarian On the other hand I started to question whether halal meat was actually halal I wondered whether we could actually trust the butchers the producers or even the slaughter man in the abattoir I also questioned whether the intensive exploitation of animals rested comfortably with my understanding of Islam I concluded that there was too much doubt involved and decided to follow the advice of the Prophet peace be upon him and his noble family to leave that over which I had doubt At one point my family had pretty much turned vegetarian Meat rarely entered our house and the only time we ate meat was at friends houses Although vegetarianism is to be applauded and even encouraged I do believe that some meat is healthy All the Prophets ate meat with the grandfather of them all Ibrahim peace be upon him offering the sacrifice we still commemorate every year at the end of Hajj Upon moving to the countryside our ambition to produce slaughter and eat our own meat finally came true We used to buy lambs from farmers I would slaughter them and have someone butcher it ready for the freezer We even started to breed our own chickens The meat was fantastic not only did it taste different but it looked and felt different The texture and colour of real meat One of the benefits of living in the countryside is that you meet people that work in agriculture these are the people that bring us our vegetables and meat Through speaking to them I started to find out some things about both animal farming and supposed halal meat Animals are exploited If one sees the conditions they are born bred and die in it would horrify anyone with a good heart Chickens lead miserable lives in huge sheds sharing their space and air with thousands of others They do nothing but feed and get fat as fast as possible ready to make their way to supermarkets selling them as Value meat or to a Chicken Cottage on the high street Larger animals face similar problems Lambs are pumped full of steroids to make sure they don t die ewes with hormones so they give birth out of season and both feed on grass treated with insecticides Cattle are sometimes born and bred in sheds they never see daylight or eat a blade of grass Muslims need to ask whether this is something they are truly happy eating Is it good to eat meat that is full of rubbish that led a miserable life and a stressful end Is it not possible that all this transfers into the meat One also needs to ask if this method of farming sits with the ethos and spirit of Islam Does Islam not teach compassion kindness and does it not fight exploitation To me both these elements make most of the meat in the UK inedible I do not want to subject my body to such produce and I definitely do not want to contribute towards an industry that exploits a community that praises Allah Quran 13 15 17 44 and 22 18 Through an increasing interest in the whole area of meat animal welfare and organic food I wanted to see whether local abattoirs would be open to me coming in and slaughtering animals My talks and visits to some local abattoirs confirmed all my previous suspicions about halal meat in the UK The first abattoir I ever called told me that there was no problem in coming and doing halal meat as they already had someone who did that Upon questioning the abattoir it turned out that he man who did that was Muslim but did not slaughter them himself but processed them normally meaning they were killed by non Muslims He reads a prayer on them or something then gives them to us were the exact words Another local abattoir informed me that all we do is halal meat Again after some probing I found out that none of the slaughter men were Muslim The abattoir had actually entered into a deal with a Muslim who was processing them in this tucked away abattoir and selling the meat as halal As you can imagine I was shocked So as you can see there are some people out there that do not seem to have a conscience They are pumping out thousands of carcasses of haram meat to butchers and restaurants and you are eating it However my problems with halal meat do not stop there I also question the hygiene standards of a lot of Muslim owned abattoirs The vet at my abattoir once said to me that he has seen places in Birmingham that were covered in shit How can you call that halal he asked me My other issue is with the slaughter men As someone who visits an abattoir every week and does between 10 30 lambs I know your mind drifts It makes me question whether those that work as slaughter men full time really remember to say Bismillah Allahu Akbar or even pay attention to what they are doing This is not their fault but a consequence of the high demand for meat and the need to process so many animals per day As a result of all this thinking research and experience I have made an oath not to eat halal meat ever again unless I know exactly where it has come from I am not advocating that everyone does this as I appreciate this is not always possible but to anyone who has taken the time to read this I would ask you to really question your relationship to meat The Companions may Allah be pleased with them are known to have made themselves sick upon discovering that the source of some food was doubtful A lot of my conclusions are purely personal I wish modern day Sheikhs and scholars would address the issues of intensive farming animal rights and what we eat This whole area is sadly lacking and needs to be examined in order to give us some guidelines At the end of the day those that simply want meat can put their trust in a logo It is those that want something better for themselves their children and animals that need to start thinking about the meat they eat and taking some tough decisions by Muhammad Ridha Payne Thanks 	1
