Which school is better Voltaire or Bonaparte Hey Considering a move to Qatar What do you recommend as a French speaking school Voltaire or Bonaparte 	Bonaparte is probably much more famous than Voltaire Apart from Candide no one bothers with Voltaire s literary works any more Yes he was a leading force in the Enlightenment and he has had some influence on French thought but Napoleon s influence upon the whole of Europe was far more profound I suppose that you could compare Napoleon to Hitler as in some ways Napoleon was responsible for a series of wars that affected the whole of Europe from the gates of Moscow to Madrid On the other hand Napoleon was not a racist and certainly never even contemplated genocide To be fair to Napoleon it is true to say that the old monarchies of Europe were very unhappy with the appearance of republican France and therefore they set out to squash the Revolution by force of arms So Napoleon did not start the wars that dragged on until 1815 but he certainly continued them very successfuly for a long while and his final defeat also meant the end of the Revolution and the return of the Bourbons 	1
Which school is better Voltaire or Bonaparte Hey Considering a move to Qatar What do you recommend as a French speaking school Voltaire or Bonaparte 	Both are good schools but Bonaparte will teach your kids to become a good leader but they concentrate mainly on outdoor physical activities manoeuvers amp strategies Horse riding and lances amp swords are their speciality They also concentrate on proper health hygiene amp sanitation and frequently remind the kid about properly using water in the loo which the gauls generally dislike So they will make a good manager amp strategist of you kid on the other hand Voltaire will make your child more of a philosopher They encourage independent thinking and mainly concentrates on indoor activities They inculcate good moral values in the child and he will surely grow up to be a thinking person In school they encourage kids to read great works of science and fiction The literary skills in your kid will bloom In addition they also teach the art of candid photography amp journalism Specialization Wit amp sattire in poetry amp Prose 	1

 to re gift or not do you find it tacky or practical to recycle unused unopened gifts and give them to other people i would really love to know your opinions about this matter thanks 	You just have to be savvy enough to not regift the thing to the person who gave it to you initially Sounds easy enough but when you ve been stashing things in your closet for 12 months you kind of forget where and who they came from My theory is that it s better those gifts go to someone else who might actually use and appreciate them than to sit unused in my spare bedroom for months on end And my friends and I usually have a Chinese gift exchange around the holidays and that s an absolutely perfect opportunity for everyone to get rid of those types of items And some folks walk away really loving the new item they picked up Most plain girls are virtuous because of the scarcity of opportunity to be otherwise Maya Angelou	1

What is under the abaya What do local women wear under their abayas 	It depends upon the mood of the person I think it would be more appropriate to know from where this abaya came or its origin so that one can come to conclusion Abaya the black thobe is not an Islamic order or must The only cover Islam requires women to have is to wear something which covers the whole body from head to toe amp the only thing should be visible is face hands amp feet Second thing is the dress should not be revealing or body fitting it should be something decent which should not give a hint about their figure nor it should be too loose which might attract others attention to make u a fun object Third thing that should be taken care about is the dress should have modest colours amp not shining amp lots of art work which would attract opposite gender Now coming to abaya no where in Islam it is mentioned neither is Quran nor in Ahadees Sayings of Holy Prophet PBUH Abaya is something cultural sometimes ladies are made to wear these so that they are not identified by hiding their faces too with Nakaabs face veils Majority of men make their women use face veils because they are in a culture where people make fun of families for not following cultural values sometiems out of enimity if a woman of a certain family is identifiable they kidnap her or try to harass her only to degrade any particular family Sometimes it is simply the choice of woman who feels comfortable in wearing abaya only because if she comes out in normal islamic dress she ll have several stares from other women forget about men at this stage So instead of answering everyone why she is not following cultural values dresses she prefers to make their mouth shut by being one of them Sometimes its too humid outside amp if the lady wants to follow her islamic dressing too she might wear something short inside amp on it she can wear a loose abaya thus giving her comfort no sense of guilt So there are several possibilities that come with abaya thing My own thinking is that abaya is a full dress its something like a man wearing shalwar kameez or a woman wearing skirt shirt or an arabic man wearing white thobe so there is no need to wear additional dress to it Briefs or vests are okay to make urself comfortable but wearing a skirt shirt then wearing a abaya for a corniche walk that goes beyond my mind But yes if you are working in a woman only environment amp as humans like to show off what new dress or shoes do they have they remove their abayas in there amp move along with whatever decent they are wearing Looks like I have written something boring so better to finish it off here Cheers CONFUSE if you cannot convince lt a href http www glitterfy com gt lt img src http img34 glitterfy com 342 glitterfy063341T565F gif alt Glitter Words border 0 gt lt a gt lt br gt lt 	1

entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	My old sparring partner Squarepeg is quite right of course A lot of schools in Doha have little or no provision for SEN children and there is not much in the way of EAL support either Trying to get the students through a curriculum that is in their second language is no easy task so of course many schools would prefer to have more students for whom English is their mother tongue If a school has a significant proportion of Qatari students then of course the Supreme and Absolutely Perfect Education Council of Qatar will want to make sure that the little darlings are getting lots and lots of lessons in Arabic and Islamic Studies That s a fat lot of use if your family are not Muslims and and you speak English as your first language Learning Arabic may sound like a fun thing for your child to do but it isn t because the Arabic teachers follow the Supreme and Immaculate Education Council s orders and therefore they teach it in a really dull and useless way instead of concentrating on conversational Arabic that could be useful and enjoyable As for Islamic Studies the teachers who are usually Egyptians or Lebanese do not want to lose their jobs and so they let the students see the exam papers before the actual exams so that they can memorise all of the answers Then the students get amazingly high marks and everyone is happy 	1

entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	To keep the forum on track you are from the UK so I wouldnt worry in the least about the entrance exams These exams are general knowledge tests which determine what level she is at and her english abilities As for Islamic and arabic studies they arent mandatory at a lot of international school only in some instances are arabic lessons mandatory but certainly not Quran Diplomacy is the art of saying Nice doggie until you can find a rock Will Rogers 	1
entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	Amoud has kindly suggested that Islamic Studies and Arabic are not mandatory at some schools in Qatar He or she may well be right The bad news however is that long waiting lists and lack of places ARE mandatory it would appear at all of the better schools in Doha These are usually the ones that do not have lots of Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum Yes a British passport does indeed come in handy but so does a very big pile of cash The better schools know that they are oversubscribed and so surprise surprise they put up their fees accordingly I have no problem at all with the idea of expat children learning Arabic I do however get very annoyed with the way that the Completely Wonderful Education Council insists that expat children should be taught Arabic in a way that is totally boring lifeless and insipid When I was teaching in Doha several expat parents told me that they were happy for their children to learn Arabic but they wanted them to learn conversational Arabic that the children could actually use When I quizzed the teachers they said that the Utterly Amazing Education Council laid down the law about how Arabic should be taught so it is just another example of the Totally Magnificent Education Council screwing things up Great to hear from you again Squarepeg I am now teaching at a school in the UAE but I thought that it might be fun to have a look at Qatar Living for old times sake 	0
entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	Hippo what you are telling her has absolutely nothing to do with what she is asking and to be honest a british passport does nothing for her if she is applying to a non British school and then may not have much weight if the school does not have a policy of allowing entrance to it nationals first Also the huge pile of cash is baloney as well If you have the money to pay the fees or the company pays thats sufficient The exams are also for the 2010 start which she will have sufficient time for climbing the waiting list It isn t as cynical as you make it seem and I may add that the Qatar canadian school is governered by the Ministry of Education and offers neither arabic nor Quran at this point but do offer french as it is the second language of Canada Diplomacy is the art of saying Nice doggie until you can find a rock Will Rogers 	0
entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	Amoud what you are suggesting to everyone not just the original person who first posted the question is that the school fees at most or all schools in Qatar are very reasonable Or maybe you are saying that if the school fees are a bit high then it is not a problem at all because your company will always pay Many parents are not in this happy situation Amoud and sometimes there is a BIG gap between what your company is prepared to pay and what the school expects you to pay Your comment about climbing the waiting list assumes that you have in fact been given a place on the waiting list If you bother to look back at previous postings on Qatar Living you will find that plenty of parents have been told that the waiting list is full for the school of their choice so how can they climb the waiting list Just in case you have not noticed Amoud again and again on this forum there have been postings about which schools in Doha are the best Compass DESS Park House and Doha College have frequently been mentioned by parents as being some of the best schools in Doha Guess what They are all British schools and a British passport though not compulsory is highly desirable if you want your child to go to one of these schools The American School also has rave reviews and surprise surprise the fees are probably the highest in Doha Hence my comment about piles of cash coming in handy 	0
entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	Again Hippo has absolutely nothing to do with what the poster is asking I am sure she is aware of the school fees if she is sitting for an exam for 2010 The rest is nonesense as well I have been here 10 plus years and my children have been given places in more than half of the schools you mention and we dont have British passports nor is our school funding coming from our company People who complain about not having a spot in school are the ones who wait until the last minute to register She is registering for September 2010 If I do recall it is now November 2009 more than 10 months in advance Diplomacy is the art of saying Nice doggie until you can find a rock Will Rogers 	0
entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 11 stage Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her Any advice gratefully received 	 Please help We are trying to move out to Doha from the UK this October but are coming up against a brick wall with school places Every school seems to be full with waiting lists How on earth do you get your kids in to schools especially those teaching Engliush curriculum It seems to be impossible I just came across this new posting today Amoud and it does seem to suggest that getting a school place for your child is not as easy as you suggest I am not an economist but I do believe that there is something called The Law of Supply and Demand If there is a shortage of something the price goes up This is what has happened and continues to happen in many schools in Doha especially the British schools I have already mentioned 	0

Tourist Visa Rule Changes Hi Has anybody heard of any changes to the tourist visa rules believe u cannot avail the same anymore from the immigration at the Airport and have to be done only thru the hotels 	Hey if this is true Hotels are going to hike up the already very high rates and make a bounty at the cost of residents who want to get their relatives over here for few days fail to understand we want to compete with UAE in all other matters but in this case we go in the opposite direction this is not fair MOI is not helping residents but the hotels to do business at the cost of residents 	1
Tourist Visa Rule Changes Hi Has anybody heard of any changes to the tourist visa rules believe u cannot avail the same anymore from the immigration at the Airport and have to be done only thru the hotels 	Tourist Visa headache I went down to the building opposite the airport the other day to try and get a visa for the mrs As i walked in I was surprised to find that there were only two people in there When I went there in June the place was balls to the wall with bodies Anyhow I politely went up to the females who sit and process the visas the freindly lady sent me over to the opposite desk to the not so friendly official who is suppost to stamp your form and check your documents Now when i walked in the building this guy was obviously on the dog big time however when I came walking over he was suddenly overcome with work and far too busy to be arsed with the likes of some expat who s looking to bring more expats in the country So he looks at me with distain that would topple a camel and tells me the form that I ve just 2 hours ago downloaded from the net is no longer valid and they ve changed the rules Obviously i should have known this information he was somehow bemused that my world didn t revolve around the ever changing Qatar visa system and the fact that i didn t know the changes that had been implemented only last week he could not comprehend He then bamboozled me with some number and name of a travel agent of the name he said so fast it sounded and i actually wrote down Quarabatra travel it was only later after i repeated this to the woman at the end of the qtel directory enquiries that i found out he was actually saying Cleopatra Travel This company were even less helpful than the visa official bottom line if you want a visa you ll have to get one through the hotels but there is always a loop hole and being a Brit we always find em The hotel will get you a 30 day visa so if like me you want your tourist to stay at your place just get the hotel for a night also that way the hotel gets to clean your bed sheets after you haven t seen the mrs for 2 months its going to get sweaty Cheapest hotel i found was the Intercontinental QR1000 19 bulls t charge	1
