diet and fitness what is the effective way to lose weight i m not obese but i want to lose weight some of my friends told me not to eat rice bread and pasta is this right 	there is no one diet for all we all have different body types metabolisms activity levels etc cutting out carbs is one way to reduce your caloric intake like the atkins diet but unless its a permanent change ie lifestyle change and not just a diet for a certain period the weight tends to return generally speaking unless there are medical reasons mostly to do with metabolism a person s weight is a function of how many calories they itake and how many they work off by exercising and exercising doesn t just mean the gym the best advice i can give you is not to follow a pre printed diet but go to a nutritionist who can tailor a diet for your specific body type and needs at least that s what i would do in canada i don t even know if there are certified nutritionists in qatar hope that helps and whatever you decide good luck stay safe perfection does not exist the question therefore is what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for 	1

moving to qatar ras laffen hi does anyone know a company called ras gas i am considering moving there with my family does someone live in that city or he has to commute to doha what about school for a 3 year old boy i will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer 	hi sloopjohnd i have only lived here for a few weeks but will happily offer my humble opinion i work on the ras laffan idustrial estate but not for qatargas so i cant give any opinions on qatargas it is based very near my company so the commute would be very similar its not so bad most of the way is easy virtually the same road doha is the hardest part the driving is crazy with a family it is defitiely better to be living in doha everything you need is there and you can enjoy a good standard of living all the schools are there too i think the people seem ok crime is very low and you never feel like you would walking the streets in other cities there are lots of activities all over and if you join a club like the doha club or something you can get family membership i cant speak for the heat in summer but i would imagine its quite unbearable but with air con etc it should be fine and the winter weather is meant to be glorious there is a book which i got from amazon that came in useful called qatar the complete residents guide that will give you lots of info and really is worth the money one point which i didnt know is that you can upgrade your driving licence in the uk anyway for free to an international driving licence you need to do it before you arrive i dont know if you can email me or whatever for more advice but i would be happy to answer any questions doha is a good place to live and much better than anywhere near ras laffan theres realy not alot there anyway hope this helps mcsunny	1 
moving to qatar ras laffen hi does anyone know a company called ras gas i am considering moving there with my family does someone live in that city or he has to commute to doha what about school for a 3 year old boy i will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer 	hi thought i would give you my two cents worth my husband had been driving back and forth to ras laffan for 8 months he come to hate the drive although it is an easy ride once outside of city straight highway driving the drive takes between 45 60 minutes depending on traffic of course we moved to the new dolphin energy compound and really are enjoying it doha is close enough when we want to go into the city to do whatever compound life is awesome beautiful homes almost like a small town within the compound as for children well our youngest is 18 and they are living in canada so we didn t have to factor that into the move however i would think that compound living with children would be fine too certainly would not have to worry about day to day things that you would in a city hope this helped somewhat 	1
