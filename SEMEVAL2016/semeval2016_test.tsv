has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	i am trying to contact them and am not getting any answer by phone or email	0 
has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	if you mean if any one has adopted from qaws recently then our experience was not so good we unfortunately adopted a kitten that had ringworms and had rash on her nose and other parts of the body the new kitten gave all of the family ringworm rash leaving permanent marks on the body from this we have had her treated and now she is fine where as we fully understand that qaws is a fully voluntry organisation but we feel that they could have advised us more about the health of the little kitten 	1 
has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	 ukeng i think you were told that this kitten had been suffering from ringworm in fact if i remember rightly you were asked to return at a later date when it had cleared up if i remember we said as far as we can tell it has recovered not being vets we have never told an adopter that the animal they are adopting is 100 fully fit and healthy unless they have been to a vets we have apologised for any inconvenience and even offered to take the kitten back into the shelter which you declined it s just a shame that the one or two negative experiences people have seem to overwhelm the hundreds of animals we rescue and rehome successfully 	0 
has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	comachero apologies i have been away on vacation and i m in the process of working through the 90 odd emails all asking for assistance i will get to you as soon as possible 	0 
has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	ah comenchero that would be my fault between my actual work that sponsors me here running around for the rescue trying to help out other members on the committee with their business while they were out of the country dealing with a friend of mine who was having a relationship and emotional breakdown i am terribly sorry that i didn t get around to answering your phone calls or checking your emails as chelsea has said we do this out of the goodness of our hearts and no one seems to appreciate how much time of our own we give for these animals and we seem to get nothing in return but negative feed back someone will get back to you we are only 4 people trying to do the best we can give us a break 	0 
has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	chelsea i don t mean to dent qaws reputation any way as i mentioned that we just had a bad experience let me get this straight it was we who requested that if you would take the kittens back which you kindly accepted to do again thankyou all i am trying to highlight here as you have said that you are only a voluntry body and not a veternary service and those who are considering to adopt should have this in their mind 	1 
has anyone needed to use qaws recently if so what was your experience 	comanchero apologies that would be my fault between my actual job that sponsors me here making sure that the rescue has everything it needs running one of the other committee members companies so it didn t go belly up while she and her family where out of the country dealing with a dear friends emotional breakdown and the breakdown of her relationship as well as trying to give my own dogs and people in my life attention i am sorry that i haven t had time to answer your phone calls or tend to your emails we are 4 people 2 were away and those left here had to try deal with everything that was thrown at us we are terribly sorry if you feel neglected like we haven t been at attention when you needed us sarcastic yes but i think we have all had it with people whinging when things go wrong and never giving credit where credit is due please try to remember as chelsea has said we are not a charity nor are we governement funded we do this because we love anim 	0

palm tree island can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island 	nice beautiful if a bit unkept manmade island which served quite rightly to provide enterteinment to the desperate families who coldn t afford to pay or couldn t get into an expensive healthclub once day someone very clever decides to destroy it leaving instead a piece of sand with one tree in the middle rumours have been circulating about the next project that will take its place a fountain an acuatic ikea a swim thru mcdonals the tallest building ever made etc but so far nothing has happened and most probably nothing will ever replace that little oasis of entertainment in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do 	1 
palm tree island can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island 	once upon a time it was a small island with a little fun fair and some entertainment for faimlies than from one day to the other everything just disappeared except one single tree rumours say that it was for the safety of the doha asian games but so far nothing is there and i don t know if there will be ever again 	1 
palm tree island can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island 	two years ago when i came to this country someone lured me to go this this island one weekend it costs only 20riyals to and from the island includes the entrance fee i suppose drow boat ride there you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees watching the others swin play volleyball or the children play in the sand and since the beach side faces to the sea you ll feel like you re in a tropical island away from qatar my opinion waiters are ready to take your food order read a book while you smoke sheesha if you get hungry there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in it was my small heaven my recluse whenever i feel homesick work stressed or just plain lazy to do anything now it s just an empty island and the tree there is not even a palm tree what you are is what you have been and what you will be is what you do now buddha	1

palm tree island can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island 	 i think it was a great loss to doha when they demolished that island it was such a wonderful place to be in they also did not provide any information to the public about the reason behind this decision i guess they could have easly said because qatarisun amp her his partner have split up but butterfly there are still many places to go to here amp many things to do in doha i don t think there is absolutely nothing to do in this city azi as you can see i am able to discuss things wisely with no bashing but hushhhh dont tell anybody 	1 
palm tree island can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island 	 there are still many places to go to here amp many things to do in doha of course there are the parks and the malls and if you can spend the money the expensive hotel s beach clubs otherwise you need to drive away from doha to find a half decent beach us we now go to the beach near the intercontinental that is if it can be called a beach 	0

sleeping pills has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them and if so are they what we we as in westerners would call perscribtion sleeping pills 	i had to stay overnight at the hamad hosp while a couple monitored me all night from another room i was wired up all over the place which for me wasn t too comfortable and then left to sleep which i did very little of anyway as i didn t like the wiring i was also diagnosed by the maxillo facial surgeon who checked the size of my jaw tongue etc etc and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea i didn t do the sleeping pills run as i had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue sounds gross but wasn t really that bad but this is definitely the route to take as pills may not be the answer for you maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected hope you get relief soon i know what you re going thru angelwings	0

a good tip for waiter in a restaurant hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips an example is you pay 200 qar for a dinner a 10 qar for a tip is good 	i think it s very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters i don t even know if service actual means the waiter service best to ask the waiter if they get it or not if they don t then leave a tip if you think they deserve it for the amount you think they deserve i hate the american culture of always tipping a normal tip should reward normal service with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations but if the service is poor as it so often is here then they haven t earnt a tip in my opinion 	1
